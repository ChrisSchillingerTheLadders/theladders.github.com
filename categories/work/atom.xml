<p>At TheLadders, we try to support our engineers in their continued education
in every way we can. One way we do that is with our <a href="http://dev.theladders.com/2015/02/conclave/">technology conclaves</a> which we host every Friday afternoon. They&rsquo;re an opportunity for our engineers to learn something outside of their day-to-day work. Past topics have included everything from an introduction to data science and how compilers work to a deep dive into HTTP and how to prove anything (Not all of our talks are strictly technical.)</p>

<p>While we have had many people from outside of the company attend our conclaves, we always wanted to open it up even further. We understand it&rsquo;s hard for most people to get out of work to attend a talk at another company&rsquo;s office. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve started filming these talks and posting them to YouTube. We hope you enjoy them as much as we do.</p>

<p>Our first video is a lightning talk called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14OcQHxSODQ">&ldquo;A Mostly True Story about Memory&rdquo;</a> presented by <a href="http://dev.theladders.com/ourteam/andrewturley/">Andrew Turley</a>, one of our software architects (and manager of our Platform team.) In the video, Andy explains how memory works, all while wearing an amazing cat t-shirt.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to post more of these talks at the weeks go by so <a href="http://www.twitter.com/TheLaddersDev">follow us</a> on Twitter or subscribe to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0BhGK1ctsyDdMmE8MecYhQ">YouTube channel</a> to stay in the loop about new videos.</p>
