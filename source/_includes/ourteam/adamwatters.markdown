    <strong>Adam Watters</strong> is a Front-end Engineer at TheLadders. Previously, he was at Hacker School, where he built JavaScript games, graph traversal and sorting algorithm visualizations, and a handful of mostly pointless web applications. In a past life, Adam was a high school wood shop teacher. He still has all of this fingers.
