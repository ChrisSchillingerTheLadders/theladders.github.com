    <strong>Ambrish Misra</strong> is a Software Engineer at TheLadders. He became interested in coding when his uncle gifted him an old 286. His first programming language was Basic from the GWBasic manual, and then slowly progressed through C, C++ and Java in school, college and his professional coding career. Ambrish is currently trying his hands at Python, Scala, TDD, and DDD&mdash; whenever his toddler and infant allow.
