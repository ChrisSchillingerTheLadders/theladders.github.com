    Andrew Turley is a software engineer at TheLadders. A Midwesterner by birth but a coastal elitist by choice, he likes watching the sun rise and set over large bodies of water. He lives in New York's Upper East Side with his wife and cat, tending to his small garden and keeping a watchful eye on his overburdened bookshelf. His only career regret is that has has not deployed a single line of COBOL.
