    <strong>Austin Bennett</strong> is a Data Engineer at TheLadders as of January 2015.  He enjoys exploring (in its many senses) and would prefer Sesame Street’s ’S’ day to the others, as he likes Scuba Diving, Snowboarding, Semiotics, and Sailing among other S’s.  He currently is experiencing what it's like to come into the same office every weekday - a first for him, since historically primarily he has been an academic (esp: Cognitive Science/Linguistics, and Literature) or a consultant.
