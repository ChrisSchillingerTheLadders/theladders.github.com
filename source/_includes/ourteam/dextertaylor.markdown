    <strong>Dexter Taylor</strong>, Lead Software Engineer, began his career 19 years ago as a C++ programmer at a tech startup in NYC. Since then he's worked for a range of companies on the New York tech scene, including Razorfish, Bloomberg News, and Mail.com.

	Dexter took a break from the software industry in the mid-2000's to work as a location sound engineer for independent film and TV, and has also taught sound recording and postproduction at NYFA and Long Island University. These days he spends his spare time inventing things with chips in them, learning Scala and Erlang, recording music, and hanging out with a motley assortment of creative troublemakers. Dexter is also a licensed NYC yellow cabbie, and can proudly say he has never run over a single pedestrian who didn't deserve it.
