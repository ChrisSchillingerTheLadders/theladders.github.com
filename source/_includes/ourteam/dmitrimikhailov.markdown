    <strong>Dmikhailov</strong> is Principal Data Architect for TheLadders. Since joining the Company in 2004 he's had to wear many hats: writing code for both the website and internal tools, designing data structures, optimizing payment systems among many other things. While moving all these disparate bits around (many!), he's never panicked in those inevitable “the site is down!” situations. Dmitri is able to communicate in 15 different languages, including binary codes with a wide range of computers: from IBM 360 mainframes to tiny PLCs. His latest hobbies include 3D graphics, Linux kernel programming, studying the Chinese language, and trophy fishing.
