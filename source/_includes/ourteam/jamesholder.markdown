    <strong>James Holder</strong> is a Software Engineer at TheLadders. When not exploring the wonders of New York, he loves to get deep in a good book or to write a few of his own. Inspired by Uncle Bob, he intends to pen the first test-driven novel. Ruby and JavaScript scratch his programming itch, though purer functional languages have also caught his eye. You can earn his eternal friendship by asking him about giant robots.
