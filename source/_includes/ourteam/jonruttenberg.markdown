    <strong>Jon Ruttenberg</strong> s a Senior Software Engineer at TheLadders. He gave up show business to write code. He believes that it is possible to admire both C++ and Functional languages. Pointers and system calls do not scare him, but assembly language does. He thinks that Erlang is way cool and that it needs to be used more on this side of the Atlantic. He does not believe that JVM-based languages will bring world peace.
