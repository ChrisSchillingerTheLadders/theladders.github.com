    <strong>Jose Medina</strong> is a Front end Engineer at TheLadders.  He is always dabbling in new frameworks and all things involved with software development.  Most likely you can find him in front a computer but if not, he is probably in one of the hundred pizza spots and/or beer gardens in NYC. Other interests involve napping, wandering aimlessly, and being disappointed that the NY Mets haven't made the playoffs for the nth year in a row.
