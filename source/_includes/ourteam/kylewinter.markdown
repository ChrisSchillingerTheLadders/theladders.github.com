    Kyle is a Lead Software Engineer for TheLadders.  His beliefs include putting the domain first, commitment to code quality, and that Tupac is alive.  He is currently seeking help to get over his testing OCD, but still occasionally shouts "where's the test?" when he nods off in meetings.  He is an avid JÃ¤germeister enthusiast, and has been with TheLadders since the end of 2010.
