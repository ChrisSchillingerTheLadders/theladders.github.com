    Matthew is a Software Engineer in Test at TheLadders. He also dabbles in a healthy amount of release engineering. He's gradually infiltrated dev from modest beginnings on TheLadders' Community (AKA Customer Service) team in 2008. At work, he's generally toying about with Jenkins or Webdriver, but outside the office, you can find him. I don't know where you can find him, but all sorts of things are possible in life.
