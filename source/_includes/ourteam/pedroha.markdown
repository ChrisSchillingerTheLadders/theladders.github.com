  <strong>Pedro Ha</strong> is a software developer that has been puzzled by HTML5 and Javascript in the last 5 years. His curiosity on Javascript allowed him to work at bn.com and cnbc.com. Node.js keeps that curiosity in check. His interest in building great products is leading him to look more into UX and game design.
  He believes in the Maker movement and has volunteered at Mozilla Hive Maker events.
  He's learning how to teach technology to kids at Coderdojo NYC. Pedro is joining the Ladders as a Lead Front-End Developer.
  He also enjoys gelato, one of the best inventions from Italy.
