    <strong>Pinak Jain</strong> is a Software Engineer at the TheLadders. He is always looking to learn new things about Software Development and how technology meets the business. If he was not a Engineer he would have been a sportsman. Pinak lives by the line once said by his coach "Always have a strategy, a plan B, never give up and play to <strong>win</strong> in anything you do in life". He also loves to explore the city and believes in the old adage "work hard, party harder!!!"
