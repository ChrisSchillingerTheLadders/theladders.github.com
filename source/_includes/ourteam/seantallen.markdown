    <strong>Sean T Allen </strong> is the Principal Architect for TheLadders. He started at TheLadders in December of 2010 and has engaged in one brutal refactoring after another ever since. His turn-ons include programming languages, distributed computing, Hiwatt amplifiers and Fender Telecasters. His turn-offs include mayonnaise, stirring yogurt and sloppy code. He is one of the authors of <a href="http://www.manning.com/sallen/">Storm Applied</a>; he wanted to call it "I wanna go fast" but, you know, publishers- ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. You can often find him rambling on <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanTAllen">twitter</a>.
