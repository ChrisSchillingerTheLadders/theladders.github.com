    <strong>Shankar Mishra</strong> is the Vice President of Data Science and Analytics at TheLadders. His passion is to leverage stochastic optimization principles to find a simpler solution to complex problems from different industries, such as travel, retail, media, recruitment etc. He is always game for a good brainstorming session, which may very well be with strangers in his foursome on a golf course, or with himself, on a solitary trek to capture a landscape photograph at golden hour.
