At TheLadders, we try to support our engineers in their continued education
in every way we can. One way we do that is with our [technology conclaves](http://dev.theladders.com/2015/02/conclave/) which we host every Friday afternoon. They're an opportunity for our engineers to learn something outside of their day-to-day work. Past topics have included everything from an introduction to data science and how compilers work to a deep dive into HTTP and how to prove anything (Not all of our talks are strictly technical.)

While we have had many people from outside of the company attend our conclaves, we always wanted to open it up even further. We understand it's hard for most people to get out of work to attend a talk at another company's office. That's why we've started filming these talks and posting them to YouTube. We hope you enjoy them as much as we do.

Our first video is a lightning talk called ["A Mostly True Story about Memory"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14OcQHxSODQ) presented by [Andrew Turley](http://dev.theladders.com/ourteam/andrewturley/), one of our software architects (and manager of our Platform team.) In the video, Andy explains how memory works, all while wearing an amazing cat t-shirt. 

We're going to post more of these talks at the weeks go by so [follow us](http://www.twitter.com/TheLaddersDev) on Twitter or subscribe to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0BhGK1ctsyDdMmE8MecYhQ) to stay in the loop about new videos.
